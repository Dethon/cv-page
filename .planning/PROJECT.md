# CV Portfolio Page

## What This Is

A personal CV/portfolio website for Juan Francisco Crespo Galán — a senior software engineer with 10+ years of experience across embedded systems, full-stack web, data engineering, and machine learning. The site serves as a polished online professional presence, deployed on GitHub Pages, showcasing career history, technical skills, and selected projects.

## Core Value

Visitors immediately understand who Juan Francisco is as an engineer — his breadth of experience, technical depth, and the quality of his work — and can easily reach out or explore further.

## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] Hero section with name, title, summary, and professional photo placeholder
- [ ] Experience timeline showing career progression (Redslim, NielsenIQ, NTT DATA, GRIAL, Audaspace, Universidad de Salamanca)
- [ ] Skills/technologies section highlighting key competencies (Spark, TypeScript, Databricks, C/C++, Python, etc.)
- [ ] Curated GitHub projects section with hand-picked repos and custom descriptions
- [ ] Education section (Master's + Bachelor's + Technical Engineering, Universidad de Salamanca)
- [ ] Downloadable CV as PDF
- [ ] Contact links: email (JF_Crespo@outlook.es), LinkedIn, GitHub
- [ ] Responsive design — works well on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- [ ] Modern, polished visual design with subtle animations and strong typography
- [ ] Deployed on GitHub Pages
- [ ] Built with React + Vite

### Out of Scope

- Blog/writing section — not needed for v1, can add later
- Multi-language support — English only
- Contact form with backend — links are sufficient
- CMS or admin panel — content managed in code
- Analytics/tracking — can add later if desired

## Context

- **Content source**: LinkedIn PDF extract available in repo (`cv.pdf`) with full career history
- **LinkedIn**: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jfcrespo5/
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/Dethon
- **Deployment target**: GitHub Pages (static hosting, no server-side)
- **Career highlights**: Remarkably diverse stack — C embedded systems, C++ audio processing (Blender/Audaspace), full-stack web (TypeScript), data engineering (Spark, Databricks), ML frameworks, financial software
- **Distinguishing trait**: Ability to learn and deliver across vastly different technology domains
- **Languages**: English (professional working), Spanish (native)
- **Location**: Spain

## Constraints

- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages — must be fully static (no SSR, no server-side APIs)
- **Stack**: React + Vite — user's explicit choice
- **Content**: English only
- **Projects**: Manually curated — no GitHub API calls at runtime

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| React + Vite over static HTML | User preference; component-based architecture for maintainability | — Pending |
| Curated projects over API-fetched | Full control over what's displayed and how it's described | — Pending |
| Single language (English) | Professional working language, broader audience | — Pending |
| GitHub Pages deployment | Free, simple, already has GitHub account | — Pending |
