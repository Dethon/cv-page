## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- React + Vite over static HTML — User preference; component-based architecture for maintainability
- Curated projects over API-fetched — Full control over what's displayed and how it's described
- Single language (English) — Professional working language, broader audience
- GitHub Pages deployment — Free, simple, already has GitHub account
- Vite scaffold fallback (tmp-scaffold) — Non-empty directory required scaffold-then-move approach
- GitHub Pages environment policy — Added `main` branch to deployment branch policies

### Pending Todos

None.
