# Roadmap: CV Portfolio Page

## Overview

Transform a professional CV into a modern, polished web presence. Starting with solid deployment infrastructure, we'll build a responsive single-page application that showcases Juan Francisco's 10+ years of engineering experience across embedded systems, full-stack web, and data engineering. Each phase delivers verifiable capability, from working deployment pipeline to complete content sections to professional polish with animations and accessibility.
