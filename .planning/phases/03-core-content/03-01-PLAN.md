<objective>
Create the content data layer (TypeScript interfaces and CV data) and implement the Hero section with real content.

Purpose: Establishes the typed data foundation that all content components depend on, and delivers the first visible content section (Hero) with Juan Francisco's real professional information.
Output: TypeScript interfaces for all CV content, populated data file with real CV data, and a fully implemented Hero section with photo placeholder.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create TypeScript interfaces and CV data files</name>
  <files>src/types/content.ts, src/data/cv-content.ts</files>
  <action>
Create `src/types/content.ts` with these interfaces:

1. `PersonalInfo` — name (string), title (string), summary (string), location (string), email (string), linkedin (string)
2. `ExperienceEntry` — company (string), roles (array of { title: string, startDate: string, endDate: string | 'Present', location: string, achievements: string[] }). Use a roles array because NTT DATA and GRIAL each have 2 roles under the same company.
3. `SkillCategory` — category (string), skills (string[])
4. `EducationEntry` — degree (string), institution (string), startYear (string), endYear (string)
5. Export a `formatDate` helper function that takes an ISO YYYY-MM string or 'Present' and returns a human-readable format like "April 2023" using `Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-US', { year: 'numeric', month: 'long' })`. For 'Present', return 'Present'.

Create `src/data/cv-content.ts` importing interfaces from `../types/content` and exporting all data:

`personalInfo`:
- name: "Juan Francisco Crespo Galan"
- title: "Senior Full Stack Engineer"
- summary: "I'm a software engineer and developer with more than ten years of professional experience. Passionate about all kinds of technology, but especially interested in software design, parallelism, and optimization in 'close to the metal' languages. I have worked with a remarkably diverse technological stack: from C in embedded systems, to full stack web development, digital signal processing, some videogame development and, more recently, machine learning. I pride myself on being able to learn most languages and frameworks in a truly short amount of time and provide efficient solutions to any kind of problem."

  <verify>Run `npx tsc --noEmit` — no type errors. Verify the data file imports compile correctly.</verify>
  <done>TypeScript interfaces exist for PersonalInfo, ExperienceEntry, SkillCategory, EducationEntry. Data file exports all CV content with correct types. formatDate helper converts ISO dates to readable format. No type errors.</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Implement Hero section with real content and photo placeholder</name>
  <files>src/components/Hero.tsx, src/components/hero.css</files>
  <action>
Update `src/components/Hero.tsx` to:
1. Import `personalInfo` from `../data/cv-content`
2. Import `./hero.css`
3. Keep importing `./sections.css` for base styles
4. Use semantic HTML: `<section id="hero">` with `aria-label="Introduction"`
5. Layout: hero-content wrapper with two children:
   - `.hero-photo` div containing a placeholder avatar (use a `<div>` with CSS-styled circle showing user initials "JFC" as text, using `var(--accent)` for border and `var(--bg-secondary)` for background). Do NOT use an `<img>` tag since there is no actual photo yet.
   - `.hero-text` div containing:
     - `<h1>` with `personalInfo.name`
     - `<p className="subtitle">` with `personalInfo.title`
     - `<p className="hero-summary">` with `personalInfo.summary`

Create `src/components/hero.css`:
- `.hero-content`: flexbox, column direction on mobile, centered text, gap 2rem
- `.hero-photo`: 120px x 120px, flex-shrink 0
- `.hero-avatar`: full width/height, border-radius 50%, background var(--bg-secondary), border 3px solid var(--accent), display flex, align-items center, justify-content center, font-size 2.5rem, font-weight 700, color var(--accent)
- `.hero-text .subtitle`: font-size 1.25rem, color var(--accent), margin-bottom 1rem, font-weight 500
- `.hero-summary`: max-width 600px, font-size 1.1rem

Tablet (768px): hero-content flex-direction row, text-align left, hero-photo 180px
Desktop (1200px): hero-photo 200px, hero-summary max-width 700px

Use ONLY existing CSS custom properties from theme.css (var(--accent), var(--bg-secondary), var(--text-primary), var(--text-secondary), etc.). Do NOT introduce new custom properties.
  </action>
  <verify>Run `npm run build` — builds without errors. Run `npm run dev` and verify Hero section renders with name, title, summary, and circular placeholder at localhost.</verify>
  <done>Hero section displays "Juan Francisco Crespo Galan", "Senior Full Stack Engineer", full professional summary, and a circular avatar placeholder with initials. Layout is responsive: stacked on mobile, side-by-side on tablet/desktop.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- `npx tsc --noEmit` passes with zero errors
- `npm run build` completes successfully
- Hero section renders real content (not placeholder text)
- Photo placeholder displays as styled circle with initials
- Layout responds correctly at 320px (stacked), 768px (side-by-side), 1200px (wider)
- Dark/light theme toggle still works correctly with Hero content
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- TypeScript interfaces define all four content types (PersonalInfo, ExperienceEntry, SkillCategory, EducationEntry)
- Data file contains all real CV content extracted from the provided CV data
- formatDate helper function correctly formats ISO dates
- Hero displays name, title, summary, and photo placeholder from typed data (not hardcoded strings in JSX)
- Responsive layout works across all breakpoints
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/03-core-content/03-01-SUMMARY.md`
