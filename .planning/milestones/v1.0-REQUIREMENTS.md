## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Contact form with backend | Links are sufficient; avoids backend complexity on static hosting |
| CMS or admin panel | Content managed in code via JSON files; no need for runtime editing |
| GitHub API runtime calls | Curated content in JSON avoids rate limits and loading delays |
| 3D effects / WebGL | Overkill for professional presence; adds bundle size and complexity |
| Real-time features | No use case for a static portfolio |
| User accounts / login | Not relevant for portfolio |
| AI chatbot assistant | Gimmick; content should speak for itself |
