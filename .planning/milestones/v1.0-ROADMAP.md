## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- React + Vite over static HTML — Component-based architecture for maintainability (Good)
- CSS custom properties over CSS-in-JS — Better performance, works without JavaScript (Good)
- IntersectionObserver over scroll events — More efficient, battery-friendly (Good)
- Curated projects over API-fetched — Full control over presentation (Good)
- react-helmet-async with --legacy-peer-deps — React 19 compatibility workaround (Revisit)
- Manual Vite chunk splitting — Optimal browser caching for vendor dependencies (Good)

**Issues Resolved:**

- Parallel git conflicts: agent 03-02 placeholder skills.css overwritten by agent 03-03 — manually restored
- ROADMAP.md not updated by parallel agents — orchestrator corrections applied
- Light mode accent color contrast ratio below WCAG AA — fixed from #3b82f6 to #2563eb

**Issues Deferred:**

- Lighthouse performance verification — Chrome not available in WSL2, manual check needed after deployment
- react-helmet-async React 19 official support — using --legacy-peer-deps workaround

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- public/ directory gitignore conflict with cv.pdf requiring force-add
- react-helmet-async --legacy-peer-deps flag pending upstream React 19 support
